# Industrial-Edge-Gateway-Resilient-Alert-System
This repository contains the final project for the Advanced Embedded Linux Development course. This project implements a complete IIoT (Industrial IoT) gateway on the BeagleBone Black using Yocto Scarthgap. It features custom Linux Kernel Modules (LKM), a multithreaded C++ system daemon, and an MQTT-based telemetry interface.
